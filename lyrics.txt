"The lunatic is in the hall / The lunatics are in my hall"
"The paper holds their folded faces to the floor / And every day the paper boy brings more"
"And if the dam breaks open many years too soon / And if there is no room upon the hill / And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too / I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
"The lunatic is in my head / The lunatic is in my head"
"You raise the blade, you make the change / You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane"
"You lock the door and throw away the key / There's someone in my head but it's not me."
"And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear / You shout and no one seems to hear / And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes / I'll see you on the dark side of the moon"
"I can't think of anything to say except... / I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha!"

"All that you touch / And all that you see / All that you taste / All you feel / And all that you love / And all that you hate / All you distrust / All you save / And all that you give / And all that you deal / And all that you buy, / Beg, borrow or steal"
"And all you create / And all you destroy / And all that you do / And all that you say / And all that you eat / And everyone you meet / And all that you slight / And everyone you fight / And all that is now / And all that is gone / And all that's to come"
"And everything under the sun is in tune / But the sun is eclipsed by the moon."
"There is no dark side of the moon, really. / Matter of fact, it's all dark."

WYWH ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze."
"Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!"
"You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze."
"Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!"

"Welcome my son, welcome to the machine."
"Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been."
"You've been in the pipeline, filling in time, / provided with toys and Scouting for Boys."
"You bought a guitar to punish your ma, / And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool"
"So welcome to the machine."
"What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream."
"You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar"
"He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar."

"Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar, you're gonna go far."
"You're gonna fly high, / You're never gonna die, / You're gonna make it if you try, / They're gonna love you."
"Well, I've always had a deep respect, / And I mean that most sincerely."
"Your band is just fantastic, That is really what I think."
"Oh by the way, which one's Pink?"
"And did we tell you the name of the game, boy? / We call it Riding the Gravy Train."
"We're just knocked out. / We heard about the sell out."
"You gotta get an album out, / You owe it to the people. / We're so happy we can hardly count."
"Everybody else is just green"
"Have you seen the chart? / It's a hell of a start, / It could be made into a monster / If we all pull together as a team."

"So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain."
"Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? / A smile from a veil? / Do you think you can tell?"
"Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? / Hot ashes for trees? / Hot air for a cool breeze? / Cold comfort for change?"
"Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?"
"How I wish, how I wish you were here."
"We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, / Running over the same old ground."
"What have we found? / The same old fears. / Wish you were here."

"Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there. / Shine on you crazy diamond."
"And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, / sail on the steel breeze."
"Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, / come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!"

Animals ------------------------------------------------------------------------
"If you didn't care what happened to me, / And I didn't care for you"
"We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain / Occasionally glancing up through the rain / Wondering which of the buggers to blame"
"And watching for pigs on the wing."

"You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need"
"Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street"
"You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed"
"And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight / You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking."
"And after a while, you can work on points for style"
"Like the club tie, and the firm handshake / A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile"
"You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to / So that when they turn their backs on you / You'll get the chance to put the knife in!"
"You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder / You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older"
"Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south / Hide your head in the sand"
"Just another sad old man / All alone and dying of cancer."
"And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown"
"And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone"
"And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around"
"So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone / Dragged down by the stone.""
"I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused / Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used"
"Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise"
"If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?"
"Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending / That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend"
"And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner / And everything's done under the sun"
"And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer."
"Who was born in a house full of pain / Who was trained not to spit in the fan / Who was told what to do by the man / Who was broken by trained personnel / Who was fitted with collar and chain / Who was given a pat on the back / Who was breaking away from the pack"
"Who was only a stranger at home / Who was ground down in the end / Who was found dead on the phone / Who was dragged down by the stone."

"Big man, pig man, ha ha, charade you are"
"You well heeled big wheel, ha ha, charade you are"
"And when your hand is on your heart / You're nearly a good laugh / Almost a joker"
"With your head down in the pig bin / Saying "keep on digging" / Pig stain on your fat chin"
"What do you hope to find? / When you're down in the pig mine"
"You're nearly a laugh / You're nearly a laugh / But you're really a cry."
"Bus stop rat bag, ha ha, charade you are"
"You fucked up old hag, ha ha, charade you are"
"You radiate cold shafts of broken glass"
"You're nearly a good laugh / Almost worth a quick grin"
"You like the feel of steel / You're hot stuff with a hat pin / And good fun with a hand gun"
"Hey you Whitehouse, ha ha, charade you are"
"You house proud town mouse, ha ha, charade you are"
"You're trying to keep our feelings off the street"
"You're nearly a real treat / All tight lips and cold feet"
"And do you feel abused?"
"You gotta stem the evil tide / And keep it all on the inside"
"Mary you're nearly a treat / Mary you're nearly a treat / But you're really a cry."

"Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away"
"Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air"
"You better watch out / There may be dogs about"
"I've looked over Jordan and I have seen / Things are not what they seem"
"What do you get for pretending the danger's not real?"
"Meek and obedient you follow the leader / Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel"
"What a surprise / A look of terminal shock in your eyes"
"Now things are really what they seem / No, this is no bad dream"
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want / He makes me down to lie / Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by / With bright knives he releaseth my soul"
"He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places / He converteth me to lamb cutlets / For lo, he hath great power and great hunger"
"When cometh the day we lowly ones / Through quiet reflection and great dedication / Master the art of karate / Lo, we shall rise up"
"And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water"
"Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream"
"Wave upon wave of demented avengers / March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream"
"Have you heard the news? / The dogs are dead!"
"You better stay home / And do as you're told"
"Get out of the road if you want to grow old"

"You know that I care what happens to you / And I know that you care for me too"
"So I don't feel alone / Or the weight of the stone"
"Now that I've found somewhere safe / To bury my bones"
"And any fool knows a dog needs a home / A shelter from pigs on the wing"
